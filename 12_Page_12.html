        >Feeling a pain as if biting my side, I raised myself. It was a snake.
        When I arrived at the place led by the snake, a pair of ropes appeared.
        The rope was hanging from a pulley located at the top of the tower. It
        was something I had never seen before. When I picked one and grabbed it,
        the rope turned into a snake and tied my body together. The pulley began
        to move smoothly. I felt my body slowly moving away from the ground.
        Something was coming down from the top of the tower tied to a rope. I
        could tell at once what it was.</a
